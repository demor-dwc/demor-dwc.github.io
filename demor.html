	<h3>What is DEMOR?</h3>
	<p>DEMOR is a psycho-physical philosophy that emphasizes a system approach to wellness. DEMOR incorporates Hotspot Therapy (a new Massage Technique) and T.E.A.M. W.O.R.K.O.U.T. (a new concept in personal training) along with a proper balance of nutrition: carbohydrates, proteins and fats for a holistic approach to a fit way of living. The DEMOR System approach to wellness is designed to be used as a prescription for overall mental, physical and emotional soundness. Most importantly it is structured to be a blueprint for physically looking and feeling good about you.</p>
	<p>DEMOR System begins with a daily workout with a proper balance of nutrition: carbohydrates, proteins and fats; followed by a good dose of feeling good about you to help maintain a determined mindset so you are able to move beyond “I should, could, would or ought to” thinking.</p>
